## Clustering banking customers by use 

As an exercise in unsupervised learning and PCA, I used banking information to identify banking customers based off a number of factors. These results can easily be used by banks as a way to inform themselves what groups to market to, and is a good example of whats possible through unsupervised learning, a relatively easy process that can yeild powerful results. 

I created a pipeline for this model using joblib, and deployed it using the AWS cloud.
